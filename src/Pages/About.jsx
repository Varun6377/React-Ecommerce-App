      Skullcandy's products are primarily targeted at the outdoor action sports demographic
      (snowboarders, skateboarders, etc.) and general consumer market, but they have expanded 
      in recent years into the premium audio market with products such as the Crusher headphones.
      Skullcandy products are sold through retailers, specialty outlets, corporate incentive programs
      and the company's online store.

      <h1>Company history</h1>
      <h3 className='third-para'>
      Skullcandy was founded by Rick Alden and Cris Williams in 2003. The first Skullcandy product, the Skullcandy Portable Link,
      was  introduced at the 2003 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada. The LINK system combines headphones  
      with hands-free cellular technology, allowing users to listen to music from a portable audio device, while making and receiving calls   
      through their cellphone. Skullcandy holds a patent for the wireless version of LINK technology.
      In December 2008, Skullcandy products   were described as "the world's coolest ear bud," by Fortune magazine.
      In April 2011, Skullcandy purchased headphones manufacturer   Astro Gaming from Astro Studios for an unknown amount of cash.
      On January 28, 2011, Skullcandy filed for an initial public offering with   the Securities and Exchange Commission.
      This announcement was met with some criticism from financial press.
      On June 24, 2016, Incipio,   a maker of phone cases, wireless speakers, and other accessories, 
      announced plans to acquire Skullcandy for $177 million; however, the   deal later fell through as 
      Incipio refused to submit a proposed amendment to the merger agreement and Skullcandy terminated the   agreement.
      Skullcandy considered numerous other offers, eventually agreeing to be acquired by Mill Road Capital for 
      $196.9 million   at $6.35 per share. The deal was finalized and completed on October 3, 2016, and the company became a private business again.
